# pico-8

A collection of my experiments, code, and carts for the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console. This repository will serve as my personal playground as I explore the world of tiny games, creative coding, and demoscene-inspired projects.

## About

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a fantasy console for making, sharing, and playing tiny games and other computer programs. It uses a Lua-based scripting language and is designed to encourage creative limitations—perfect for prototyping and learning about game development.

In this repository, you'll find:

- 🕹️ PICO-8 carts (`.p8` and `.p8.png` files)
- 📝 Source code for games, tech demos, and experiments
- 📄 Notes, sketches, and ideas as I learn and create

## Structure

- `carts/` — Finished or in-progress PICO-8 games and demos
- `src/` — Source code, tools, and helper scripts
- `notes/` — Design docs, references, and learning notes

*Folder structure may evolve as the collection grows.*

## Getting Started

To play or edit any of the carts:

1. Download and install [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
2. Clone this repository:

   ```
3. Open PICO-8 and navigate to the repo's `carts/` directory.
4. Load and play with any `.p8` or `.p8.png` file!

## Why PICO-8?

- Small scope, big creativity
- Emphasis on retro aesthetics and design constraints
- Great platform for learning programming, pixel art, and chiptune music
